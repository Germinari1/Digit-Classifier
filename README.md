# Digit-Classifier
A convolutional neural network that recognizes hand-written digits with +99% accuracy. It uses the MNIST dataset to accomplish this task, along with ML frameworks such as TensorFlow.

## Why should you care
Recognizing and classifying handwritten digits is a common task for many real-world applications, but it can require long periods of time and relevant personnel when done on large scales. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automate this process with high accuracy, therefore, brings efficiency and automation to the mentioned process.

## Quick start and requirements
The requirements for this project can be quickly installed via this command-line command:
```txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, a user should be able to open the notebook and run each of its cells.
